      "I always hoped I would never be writing this but my wife was given the news last week that her metastatic breast cancer was no longer treatable. Seven years ago she was diagnosed with stage 1b HER + tumour in her right breast which was surgically removed followed by radiotherapy and chemo, immunotherapy etc then at 4 years 10 months she was diagnosed with brain mets which were removed followed by radio therapy an chemo again, this year in April the scans showed liver mets and a small one in her lung. The hard part for me was to watch her look so beautiful again and then have to go through the same over again. The liver mets would not respond to any chemo of which 3 were tried and it was only when my wife begged the consultant to try another that she was offered it but we were told that it won't work due to the last few not working.  Her liver has become so swollen that it is pushing against everything, she cannot eat, totally dry mouth and she came out of the shower last night and cried with me but she looked so scared, it is killing me to witness this, the dignity is being taken from her and she has asked to go into a hospice. For gods sake there must be something some one can do in this day and age where we can drop a bomb so surgically any where in the world but we cannot cure a cancer.  It has ripped our family apart and I have two sons 14 and 17 and they are both so upset. I go through each day with a constant welling of tears in my eyes, struggling to shop, get meals ready.  I met her when she was 16 and I was 18 and we are now 46 and 48 respectively. You never think this could happen to you and I sat with her while the consultant delivered that uncomfortable and inevitable discussion, and even when my wife asked for something to me done about her painfully full and swollen stomach, legs and feet she was told that there is nothing that can be done. My wife now has to wait for her liver to basically get so large that it kills her in the most inhuman way imagineable. Her feet legs and knees and in her words her front privates are prolapsing. My god what a nightmare. I would jump off Beachy Head if it wasn't for the fact that I have to teenage boys that need one parent at least. I would like to know in anyones opinion if she could have radiotherapy or proton beam if only to reduce the swelling of her liver. I am having to watch torture delivered by god of whom I no longer believe in or like and my faith as a Christian is gone. I would not let my cats suffer in this way.I want the swelling in her legs and feet to be removed and there must be a way, there also must be a super human consultant somewhere in this 'Advanced 1st world' country that can help her because by god if I have to watch her leave this world in torment and pain then I will find a way of following her to make sure she is ok on the other side at some point when my boys have become men.\n",

      "Hello your words make me cry.i had a breast cancer 2,5 years ago stage 3.had chemo,surgery and radiotherapy.I was told I was \"cured\".Then In January 2019 I started to cough up mucus couldn't even eat without choking.So after x-rays and lung biopsy they found out my breast cancer returned in my lungs,liver and kidney.Except my lungs i felt ok.So I went for second opinion they done a scan and that one was saying my liver and kidney was clear !.Anyway I was on weekly chemo since August 2019.my lungs responded very well.but few weeks ago they discovered  I havec4 tumors in my brain.they said I couldn't have surgery so I had radiotherapy which was awful had 2x a blackout and was 2x sick.now I am on the chemo tablets and even returned to work. I am angry too because if they scan regularly also the head they would find out earlier.no they just scan from neck to pelvis.And they know it can spread to the brain too.i am going to have a private body scan because I don't trust them anymore.I feel sorry for your wife but my boss told me they opened a proton beam clinic in London so maybe you can contact them.I know the pain and nobody should suffer like that.i am only 43 but I am scared of pain I am ok at the moments but that can change. Take care and try to search for a private doctors thats what I will do.Denise\n",

      "Oh Denise mu wife looks so big, her stomach is so swollen and she can hardly move, it is pitiful to see her like this, two weeks ago she was relatively mobile but now she resembles an elderley lady - so weak.I have to be with her, she has always been there for me through thick and thin and shd would have done the same for me.I help her to bath, towel dry her and dress her, I have been trying to massage the fluid back from her feet to her legs and prop her legs higher than her waist but it's no good.I fear the end is near for her and we really feel that we have been ditched.The doctors are there for you when they are prescribing the chemo etc but I don't think they know what to do when it dosen't go the way they want it to.So they hand you over to the palliative care team.I am so tired now and had to keep giving her OraMorph throughout the night which was the only thing that would settle her off and to be honest I felt like drinking the bottle I was that exhasted.I am grateful for a very supportive boss who is always willing to let me be at home whenever needed.Swollen tummy, legs and feet and confused state are not a good sign and I fear the end is near.\n",

      "Hi,Firstly, I'm so sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you are doing an amazing job looking after her.My mum also has terminal breast cancer and was told last week that her treatment was no longer working and there's nothing more than can do.  She also has swollen tummy, legs and arms due to all the fluid build up. She also has fluid on her lungs which is causing her difficulty breathing normally and speaking.  My dad is caring for her along with myself. I know how hard this is on my dad so I can totally understand how hard this is for you. All I can say is take care of yourself as much as you can as you need to be as strong as possible. I also worry about my dad as I work full time (unfortunately not very understanding workplace) so most of the care is on my dad but I'm so proud of how he's taken it in his stride. I'm sure your children will feel the same (I'm 24 so abit older).As for being annoyed with the doctors, can totally relate! Unfortunately when my mum first went to the doctors after finding a lump she was told it was nothing and was sent away, no scans, nothing. Then two weeks ago before being told there's nothing more they can do she was told the treatment was holding it back and working only to be told a week later they made a mistake. Sometimes life isn't fair but we need to be strong for our loved ones and always have hope, even when it doesn't seem like there is any.wishing you and your family all the best,Sarah \n",

I know it may be of little relief, but I find that when I'm struggling to breathe and my liver is hurting, if I eat mostly fish, spinach, avocados and wholesome foods, I do feel better.  Green tea etc. Is also good.  I know these things seem pointless, but any and all respite is welcomed when you are uncomfortable.  Sending positive vibes your way.

      "Hi Yes I have her on a diet of fruit etc. and wholemeal foods, green tea.She cried her eyes out with fear and a feeling that she has lost her dignity but I tell her that I never see that and to be honest I don't.No woman deserves this hideous disease.I remember saying my vows 30 years ago and took them seriously when I say 'for better or for worse'.She told me to put her in a hospice but I will not and could never do that, she would never do that to me.I have been prescribed some different types of morphine tablets but she dosen't seem to be in pain, just discomfort.You know even at this 11th hour I cannot give up and lose hope. I will never give up on her!She managed to come out at the weekend treat myself and our two sons to a Sunday lunch and she has put up the christmas decorations and tree even though she felt so ill.She tells me off for smothering her with my kisses and affection but I'm one of those old fashioned out dated men that likes to hold the doors open for her and bring her breakfast in bed.No woman should have to go through what she has gone through:(Thank you all for your messages I really appreciate you all more than you could ever realise!  \n",

      "Hi Goodhubby, I felt so sad reading your post. My sister is in her early 50’s and was diagnosed with her2 breast cancer 2 years ago. She had chemo, mastectomy and radiotherapy, and was later given the all clear. A year later (Feb 20) she was diagnosed with brain mets, she had surgery just prior to lockdown and was told this had been a success. She wanted radiotherapy to make sure and there appeared to be some disagreement between teams and it was later decided to watch and wait. Sadly this didn’t work and the mets grew back and spread to other parts of the brain. She also now has liver mets. She’s end stage and couldn’t tolerate the chemo so had to stop. No more treatment available. I totally understand what you’re are saying about watching your wife deteriorate...my beautiful sister is now walking with a zimmer and is struggling to be mobile. She’s only really on steroids now which are helping a little. She also has a swollen stomach and her legs were really swollen but they have reduced now. Have they checked your wife for a DVT?  My sister had one and her leg was really swollen...they treated this and it improved. We have had some contact with the hospice and they were fab....they are there to support with symptoms and can get you equipment to help you manage. Please call them and ask them to come out and see you. Im so sorry but whilst its good to stay hopeful....I don’t think there is any further treatment a available that will help cure your wife. Cancer is such a horrible disease and once it gets hold to this extent then there is really nothing that can reverse it. I too have felt angry at the care my sister has received since her secondary diagnosis but have now accepted that we are where we are....and so has she. Please don’t let denial get in the way of saying the things you need to or preparing yourselves as much as you can. You sound like an amazing husband and father and your boys will need you now much more than ever....I’m so sorry for what you are all going through. Cancer is a truly awful disease! \n",

      "Hi roseywiltsOver the last week the community care team kicked in and it was amazing, we had nurses turning up each day and believe me they covered everything. I wlecomed them into my home and they left no stone unturned.I have been doing my best but each night I would be jumping out of bed when I heard my wife move or try to get to the loo.She could not get off the loo without us both struggling with each other, it is so painful to experience this when someone has been so fit and full of vitality, it has made me realize just what cancer does to a person.She asked if she could go into Hospice and her reason was that she could see I was always upset and destroyed and yes that is true but she is my wife and I took my vows seriously I would die for her.I took her in today and I cannot praise them enough, it is a beautiful place and so much compassion and warmth. They made myself and my wife feel at home and my wife got into bed and fell straight asleep under a lovely velvety blanket.I was offered food and tea and everything was covered by an onsite doctor all whom are female which fills me with confidence especially for a female patient.Coming home was not so good though, to be in the car without her and now to be in my bedroom without my wife feels very unatural.Yes my boys are at home and I have prepared food for them and chatted, they have gone to their rooms to do their own thing as they normally do being teenagers and I am left on my own on my double bed without my wife.I feel empty.I do on the otherhand feel better knowing that she has so much attention and has a different scenery and people to chat with which is what was driving her mad at home, she felt like she had been under house arrest for two years and was going crazy.I know that 99.9% she won't be coming home but you know I cannot give up hoping and there is that 0.01% that hopes that we will wake up and realize that its all been a bad dream.One day we will wake up and feel the morning sun on our skin and look over and see the person that we love cuddled up to us.I just can't understand why we havent found a cure for at least one strain of cancer cell, I know it changes as it morphs and corrupts its own DNA but why not a cure for just one of those strains?I've spent this evening getting all the laundry done and back in the draws which is something i could not do before and it has also made me focus on something rather than c____r. I know it is exactly what my wife would do - she would say to me 'shape up or ship out' but I rather think that women handle situations like this much better than men do.I can't hide my love for her though, everything we've ever done has been for each other and our family!God bless everyone here who has had or been touched by C____r!GoodHubby\n",

      "Dear good hubby,I am sending you all my strength and hope that you will get through this. I know you will because your love for your wife is a beautiful,  powerful,  thing. You will be great for your boys and she will be so proud of you.I am 52 and have stage 4 lung cancer, which I have now survived for a year. It's being treated, but I am realistic about where it will probably end and my husband will, I know, be heartbroken. It is hard but good for me to read your words.I also have 2 sons, 21 and 19, not really adults at all despite the numbers. It is a cruel disease but we have love and that is stronger.Thinking of youJoy x\n",

      "I’m so glad the support kicked in from the community care team.....we found them really good when we needed them. I literally called them and they were out the same day. We stopped the support after a few weeks as my sister seemed a little stronger and we could manage between us. But we know where they are for when we need them which I fear may not be too long away now. I am so glad you feel happy with the care at the hospice...they’re brilliant and will make sure your wife is comfortable and hopefully not in any pain! Take care of yourself too....I hope you have family/friends to support you. Your boys are lucky to have such a caring dad and your love for your wife and them is apparent. \n",
