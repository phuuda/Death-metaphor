      "Hi SamC93,Thanks for your thoughts. Like you, I find it extremely unhelpful when people say those things. Here are the things that I find completely useless:- \"What would your father want for you?\"- \"He'll always be with you\"- \"You have to live your life now\"- \"It will get better with time\"I don't WANT to live without my dad. He WAS my life. Or at least the key part of my life. He was the sunshine in my world. The idea of letting him go and living my own life (without him) is appalling to me. I'm glad you're finding strength somewhere \n",

      "Hi, I lost my mom 4 months ago and I have the same feelings.  I don't know how I can go on without her, the rest of my family, Dad and Sister are already gone. I  Ilive in the US.  Since November I went back to my place in Las Vegas, I flew to where she lived in Florida yesterday.  Last night I was very sad but OK, no crying.  Today after starting to get rid of alot of her stuff mainly old papers, I finally broke down and have been hysterical for the last hour. I can't call anybody because I don't want to cry on the phone to them.  I spent a good deal of time in her house in the past.  I keep crying out I don't want to be here anymore, meaning on this planet. However I am here and I'm going to be here and that's what's the most frightening thing.  My mother didn't have cancer but she left fairly abruptly.  I'm don't feel like a full human being without her.  I cry out begging for someone to help me, knowing there is nothing anyone can do. Yeah I spoke with my nephew 2 days ago, we were never really close except when he was growing up.  I had to tell him it's been 2 months since you called, you said you were going to call in a few days, which he denied saying, he could have called anyway he knew what I'm going through, it was also his grandmother.  I'm 61 , he's 35.  During the conversation he said, people die and you have to move on, what a ****. I'm with you Bras. I don't want to live without my mom, but the fact is I'm going to have to, I'm not going to end my life. People say you have to keep busy, it sucks that you have to do that just to get your mind off the only person that was the most important person ever in my life. I guess that's all for now, I regret so much \n",

      "Hi gpb959,I saw your post and just wanted to send a reply to say I'm sorry to hear of what you're going through at the moment - it sounds like a really tough situation and especially with the difficulties with the family too.In terms of support, the services we would usually suggest on this forum are UK-based. However there are some resources for grief on this site here which may be of some help.Wishing you all the best and I hope that in time things gradually can become a little easier for you - or more manageable at least.BenCancer Chat Moderator\n",
