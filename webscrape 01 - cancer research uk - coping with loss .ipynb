      "Hi everyone, My father died almost 6 months ago. He was my best friend, my soulmate, my inspiration, my confidant, basically the love of my life. I will never love anyone that way again. He was my other half. We communicated almost every single day in some way (although I have regrets about how I handled this, which I may share another time). The point, though, is this: I don't think I can live without him. He meant more to me than life itself. He was my oxygen, my sunshine, my everything. He was the most remarkable and wonderful human being I have ever known (and will ever know). Every day now I have the pain of realising that he won't ever be with me again. I'm writing this post for one reason: to find other people who feel the same or at least similar. Here are some things that I have NOT found helpful: - People telling me to think about \"what he would have wanted\". Yes, of course he would have wanted me to go on and live my life. But I don't see how I can live a happy life without him. - People telling me that things \"get better in time.\" Maybe they do, maybe they don't. For some people they actually don't. Some people never recover from the loss of a loved one. He wasn't just a \"loved one.\" He was EVERYTHING to me. And now I have the rest of my life to be WITHOUT him. My love for my father was deeper and more intense than anything else I've ever known. Life feels completely meaningless without him. I have no interest in starting my own family; no interest in meeting somebody; no interest in connecting with others. Without my father in my life, those things don't mean anything to me. The ONLY thing I want is to be with my father again - to wrap my arms around him and never let go. I've never felt love from anyone the way I did from him. He showered me with warmth and love. Does anyone feel the same?  Adam  \n",

      "Hi bras1548,I’m very sorry to read what you’re going through at the moment. I know there’s perhaps not much I can say to help, and it sounds like you’re most keen to hear from others who have been through something similar, but I just wanted to reply to say there is always support available if you want or need it.That can be from us on this forum, friends and family, or professional support such as that offered by Cruse. Sometimes it can also be helpful to talk things through with a counsellor, who is neutral and can listen to you and offer guidance to help you to best deal with what you’re going through.Hopefully others will be along here soon to offer further thoughts. As I say, we’re always here for support.Wishing you all the best,BenCancer Chat Moderator\n",

      "Hi Adam,I just lost my Father two weeks ago. I feel EXACTLY the same as you do. I can tell you that 100%.Its an awful feeling. My Dad was my saftey net, the one I could turn to for advise. We did everthing together, he was my business partner, my best friend, my adviser, and now he's gone. The plaster has been completely ripped off and now you feel so isolated and alone. You're totally crushed, helpless, and you don't see how you can go another day without him with you. I know, im the same and I feel like I need that advice too. What the hell do we do?The thing is Adam, we HAVE to go on.  I too keep getting told \"Your Dad would have wanted you to go on\". All i keep thinking to that reply is \"Yeah, but with him in my life, not out of it!\"  Its extremly tough but what other option do we have?  We can't cease to live too. He brought you into this life when you was a little baby, and he adored you. He wouldn't want to see child go downhill, its not right. You need to feel like this and not change a thing. All you need to do is keep waking up each day and process these thoughts. THATS IT. You'll feel terrible, you'll feel helpless. You may be on the floor howling. This is totally normal. Just accept that you've been hit by a freight train and you don't get up from that any time soon.  You need to comfort yourself whilst in this pain. I think we'll get better, in fact I know we will. I am here if you want to chat more. Trust me, I am feeling exactly like you are. You are NOT alone. Peacewind.\n",

      "Hi Peacewind, Thanks for your message. I think the ONLY thing that helps (and it doesn't help much) is hearing from other people who are also experiencing total devastation. I'm \"only\" 35 (soon 36). The thought that I'm probably going to have to spend most of my life without my dad is completely intolerable. I'm sorry, but it's just awful. I'll never love anybody like that again. I loved him so much that it hurt. If ever he was in any pain (especially psychological) my soul would burn. I have no interest in life without my dad. I need him. I want him. I need his laughter and smile. There are approximately 7 billion people on earth and I have absolutely no interest in any of them. The only person I want to be with is my dad. And I can never have that again. What kind of life/world is this? It's appalling that humans should have to experience this sort of pain. It serves no purpose whatsoever. YOu're right about needing to go on. But I don't want to. Not without my dad. Sure, I could find a partner, settle down, start my own family. But I'll never get to be with my dad again. And he's the only person I want to be with. The suffering I experience at various points each day is beyond description. I feel as if I'm going to implode, explode, pass out, go INSANE.  And the only person who could help is my dad. I've tried counselling - it was basically useless. I know there are well-meaning people out there, but well-meaning doesn't help. My dad was taken from me in HORRIFIC circumstances. It sounds like you're doing a lot better than me. I wish I had your strength\n",

      "Hi Bras,  Thanks for replying. I know you're in a bad way, there's no denying that. And I feel like my issues (as bad and as fresh as they feel) are not on the same level as yours. And you have my deepest sympathy. I dont want you to give up all hope, I dont think you can fall any further down than you already are.  You're no doubt at rock-bottom.  But I want to help you up even if its only slightly to begin with. You're suffering severe mental torture, and I feel bad I can't be there in person to share some comforting words in person. I know it sounds strange but have you tried going on long walks on your own? You'd be suprised how much getting outside and walking off stuff can help the body. You are in fight or flight mode. Thats why you're having the implosion feelings and the ones of going insane. You have to walk or even run it off. Trust me on this. It will (slightly) ease it off. You're mind is feeling like its going mad because you are trapped inside it and cant escape it. When you address the fight or flight mode it will help - for sure. Keep posing here, day by day, write everything you're feeling, it is a matter of getting it outside of your mind. There is no way we can do this quickly, we have to go through this.  I felt completely destroyed over the last two days, then as i sit here tonight, its a little better - only a little. But I know im going to crash again tomorrow - or the next day and think i cannot survive. Its AWFUL. The thing is, I do believe we will get better, we just absolutely cannot see it right now, because were living it and it seems impossible. I need you to keep waking up, day by day, whatever it takes.  When your next sat in your chair, talk to your Dad. Because he is there listening to you. Talk to him how you used to and tell him what your feeling. Believe me you'll hear him back in your mind and it will be exactly what he would say in person. Because you know him so well.  You're not alone and im here when you need me friend. Breath and read it again. You'll be ok, You really will, you just dont know you will.    \n",

      "I normally dont ever comment on things like this, I lost my daddy in December last year. He had the all clear from cancer two weeks previous. We thought things were looking up. He we went to a+e with a sore back and they admitted him. The next day we went to visit him and he asked me for help and a few minutes later died in front of me. They weren't sure what caused his death but some had suggested that the cancer had returned.. it was completely devastating. My whole body was in shock and for weeks afterwards my entire body was in pain. I had no will to live.. my daddy was truly the light of my life. We were so close. I was the definition of a daddy's girls. I cry almost every day, sometimes more than once, Songs on the radio set me off, sometimes things on the tv set me, if anyone mentions him I just burst into tears. Sometimes I will just be sitting there and I burst into tears, then I ride the wave from grief to anger and then back to grief. What makes me sad the most is when people say, think of all the lovely memories you have.. yes that's great. But I was only 29 think of the memories we should be making. He was only 60. I get cross when people say, your father would love you to do this or that or he wouldn't want you to be sad .. no my father would want me to do what makes me happy only now my greatest support just isn't there to share and celebrate any success. Yes though it is true, my daddy wouldn't want me to be sad.  He always said, dont worry about me, look after yourself but the fact is I am sad. I'm going to be sad and I hope in the future I'm not, but for now I am. Thats ok. I just take each day as comes, I'm not looking ahead atm. I'm just looking for the peace, clam and the one half of identity I am  now missing. I dont really sleep very well. I often find night time the hardest. I miss hearing the tv that we argued about being too loud all the time or the same songs on repeat on YouTube especially at bed time. Everyone I suppose deals differently. The circle of life cant be stopped for any of us unfortunately. My personal belief is that we will meet again someday. But I have resigned to the fact that i intend to do as much as possible so that when we do meet we will continue all those wonderful stories of life, success and failure. Then once more we will laugh and we will cry together. For now tho, I havent got a plan. I dont know what I'm doing, not quite sure how I'm getting through each day. Im stuck on pause for now. Perhaps life has paused to let me be me for better or worse and to understand the prospects of life and that once I start that it's a solo mission.. but I know that for now I'm not ready, I dont know when I'll be ready. I hope if you've made it this far you know that your not on your own. I hope by sharing my story that you feel a bit better or not so alone.. when a bird isn't ready to fly it doesnt mean its wings are broke, it just need to believe in one self. Like a birds wings your instinct will get you through. I will always miss my daddy, some say grief is purest sign of love. But as much as I miss and love him more than ever, I have also never been as proud of him! Just because I cant see him doesnt mean hes not my daddy and I suppose in his death I have realised the true impact he had on my life and how lucky I was and am that hes my dad. He would say, arent we so lucky to have lost someone that made saying goodbye so hard. That I certainly was like many others grieving for loved ones.\n",

I can't bear talking to counsellors, or friends or relatives because they don't have a clue. I actually don't know anybody who has a connection with their dad (or mum) like the one I had with mine. In my Google inbox over the last 10 years there are about 10,000 emails between me and my dad. 10,000. Every day a text, or an email or a face-to-face chat. Every turning point in my life, every fear, every challenge, every obstacle, every hope - it went through my dad. He was the foundation of my building, the roots of my tree, the oxygen in my atmosphere, the sun in my solar system. Life without him just isn't life. His smile was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen; his laugh was the most beautiful and pure thing I've ever heard. Simply put, I loved him more than life. Not figuratively. Literally. If you combine everything else in the universe, it's less than my dad. When he was on his death bed (and I can't even describe this as the pain in my soul when I start thinking about it is breathtaking), I wanted to go with him. I know that sounds grim, macabre, \"wrong\" but that's how it was. I NEVER want(ed) to be separated from my dad. He was more important to me than absolutely everything else combined. I took it for granted. I assumed in some sort of infantile way that I'd always have him. So now I have AWFUL regrets that destroy me - if he came back, I'd wrap my arms around him and never let go. I wouldn't leave his side.  To answer your questions about walking, actually, yes, that's one of the VERY few things that have ever helped me. However, it's tough and rather depressing to walk around now in this coronavirus situation. I was supposed to go for a holiday in Tuscany, where I would have been able to take walks in the beautiful Tuscan countryside. That will have to wait. I'm very glad to hear that you're having your UPs as well as your downs. Personally, I have approximately zero optimism or faith. The thought of spending the rest of my life without my dad is just appalling. I don't want it. The only thing I want is to cuddle my father again, hold his hand, listen to music with him (as we did), hear his laugh, see his smile.  \n",

      "As I read your response, I experienced what I was hoping to experience - the sense that others are also experiencing something like the DESPAIR that I'm experiencing. However, in another way I did not like hearing your description at all. Nobody should have to go through that. Nobody. I wish I could rewind time and take that experience OUT of your life. I can't actually describe what happened to my father at the end because it's too awful for words. it was like a prolonged scene from the Exorcist. His cancer was under control, apparently, and then the next minute the idiot oncologists tell us that he has 30 brain lesions. Not one. Not 2. Not 5. 30. There are medical studies where the entire cohort of patients doesn't have 30 lesions combined. 1 brain lesion is bad enough and normally starts to wreak havoc on people''s mental and physical functioning. 30 tears a person apart. Bit by bit. He went from being the happiest human I have ever known to the most miserable and wretched I could ever imagine. I have never seen pain and suffering like that. Everything was taken from him and there was nothing we could do. Each week things got worse. He'd lose something new. He howled and screamed in emotional agony and spiritual torment - there was nothing I could do. I would have died for him. In the end it got so horrific that I cannot even describe it. The scenes were like scenes from the Exorcist, as I say. It's the sort of thing that has always made me an atheist. No God would allow anything like that. I envy your faith. I wish I could believe (like you) that I'll see my dad again. Sadly, he and I were both atheists with no faith in an afterlife. Obviously I wish this were the Lion King where I'm Simba and I get to speak to hear from Mufasa in the clouds from time to time. However, the reality for me now is that I just have horror, terror and despair. IT's quite similar to what you describe I think.  I DO talk to him throughout the day, but it's just through sobbing and screaming and desparation. I think about him approximately every 20 minutes. But it's normally quick and superficial because I can't bear any more. I can't look at any photos AT ALL. I haven't read any of his emails or texts for months. I can't allow myself to think about, see or hear ANYTHING to do with him for more than a few seconds. It causes HORROR, if I do. Utter horror. I sense complete and total collapse. I realise that my problem is that I put all my eggs in one basket - my father. He was the be-all-and-end-all for me. If you have a large family, your own wife/husband, kids, close relatives, close friends, then maybe you can get through it. But how do you get through it when your dad was your WORLD?  I realise I'm \"supposed\" to carry on. But I'm just not interested in the world or in life or in people. Ten seconds of conversation with another person will just remind me of my dad and since nobody will ever be like him in my heart, I don't see any point.  Quite frankly, I see no meaning in life without my dad. When he went, so did life's meaning and purpose\n",

      "I hope you didn't feel as if you had to share your experience I didn't intend that, but it was a difficult read. I agree that it's hard to believe that if there is a god then how could they let someone suffer so much. It doesnt seem right or fair. I am not particularly of faith myself, I choose to believe I will see him again. I dont have answers why someone has to suffer. I just know that having to watch someone you love in pain is the hardest thing in the world and there is no word that can describe that emotional turmoil enough to others. I suppose in a way like you I'm still trying to work out the answer of how to live and live with the pain and gaint missing piece in your life. I do struggle every day. I dont have a big family, I have no kids. I spent most days with my dad. I just loved his company. I cant watch some tv programmes because hes not there to watch them. Sometimes I boil the kettle and then dont make the tea because what's the point hes not there to help me eat the biscuits. It's just hard. I hate it. On one hand, I do believe it is good to express emotions, if you have cry then cry or scream and shout. Whatever it takes as often as it takes. I feel sometimes most people dont get it. Then I remember I actually dont care what they think. I will do me.  I also dont think that you had a problem, you put your eggs where you want. I think you loved and adored a man that had shoes that no one else can fill or even come close. That is pure devotion and that is rare and something like that should be treasured. Unfortunately there is no replacements that will ever come close. I dont have answer for how do you get through without him. Im sorry about that  I wish I did for you and me both. I know people suggest counselling and say it gets easier but that's not really an answer or direction. I know for some it helps. As for myself, my own compass is broke and I dont know how to move forward or which way to go and it hasnt got easier. I just know, that each day I get up and I try again.  I think it's completely up to you when you decide to carry on, there is no going back to the norm where they arent there anymore, so take aslong as you need. Theres no time limit on this,  just because others think or feel differenty about grief and despair. I dont believe people should do things that make them uncomfortable. If you dont want to talk today thats ok if that's what you want. I personally find it very difficult talking to other because I know they will say something and I'll be upset. So there are times when i avoid conversation. I dont feel bad about it. I'm just trying to protect myself in a way I suppose. But you are 100% right there will never be anyone like him. There will never be that bond with any other human being on this planet because he was yours and nobody elses. I think for everyone the meaning if life or purpose is different. I dont really know what the meaning of life, or what the point of life actually is if I'm honest. I dont know why am I here or what exactly I'm supposed to do while I'm here. I actually dont think about it because again theres no true answer. I dont understand why we live and just die? We experience ups and downs and everything inbetween and for every person the journey is different. I think the scariest thing is feeling alone in a world were theres 9 billion people? How is that possible but at the same time it is and it's real and it's the now! We love unconditionally to be rewarded with heart break and sadness. Why?  It just doesn't make sense to me anyways. I dont know if I will ever stop crying or ever feel like I've moved on. Part of me doesnt want to because I feel like in doing so I've moved further away from my dad. Maybe I'll always experience this pain as if it was just yesterday I lost him all over again. I dont know. I just know I miss him, i constantly feel that i need him and want to hear him, I want the advice he would give or the silly jokes. The reality is hard to face. He was my best friend and father and everything I needed rolled into one perfect human being in my eyes. He will always be that to me. I really hope you find some comfort in your life. When I read your original post I feel that I wasnt so alone and i thought that you have inspired me to open up and for me thats very brave. I just want to say thanks. I'm glad I found your post.    \n",

      "Hi Adam, I have been reading your posts and can feel your pain at the loss of your beloved dad.  I too, lost my strong, funny, kind and loving dad on 8 June and said a final farewell to him yesterday.  My dad was 82 but this doesn’t stop it hurting any the less.   My dad lived his life to the full and never let the disease define him since his diagnosis last September.  He could not sit around doing nothing and was often in the garden and greenhouse in his care home, planting his beloved marigolds and pulling up weeds.  He even went AWOL a few weeks ago, deep in the middle of lockdown and just decided to go for a walk to the Co-op and Wickes next door.  I would not have had him any other way and I am immensely proud of the way he handled his cancer.  We were very lucky that dad deteriorated very quickly really and did not suffer massively with lots of pain, only in the last two weeks.   Myself and my brother were ‘allowed’ to see him on the Saturday before he died and he had lost an extraordinary amount of weight.  It was heartbreaking to see what had become of him from a fit, muscular man to just skin and bones.  Just awful.  I also lost my mum to this evil disease in February 2017 and her death was horrific.  She fought to the very end with everything she had, screaming in pain even though she had a syringe driver, and it was not until the last moments that she found peace.  The image of her fighting and scared haunted me every time I closed my eyes but, I promise you, this does fade in time.  You never forget and you can always conjure the images back up but, somehow, you just learn to live with it.  My mum and I used to speak every day and when she was first diagnosed I could not imagine not being able to do this but the human psyche is a wonderful thing and I truly hope you can find the strength to see this through. The memory of your dad passing is so very hard for you and I know you have heard this before and I know you don’t want to hear it again, but your dad loved you as much as you loved him and there is no way he would want you to torture yourself and feel such despair. Your life is not over, you are only 35, you have your mum who must be needing comfort too.  Be kind to yourself and turn the awful loss into a new start for you. I don’t know what your beliefs are with regard to the afterlife - I am not religious and my dad wasn’t either, indeed, he always said that “when you’re gone, you’re gone”, but I have always been fascinated by the spirit world.  I was recommended to a medium called Debra Chalmers and I contacted her following a strange occurrence that happened after we had collected dad’s belongings from the care home when a car was coming towards us with the registration DAD.  Debra telephoned me and said that dad was there with mum she described them both perfectly and I did feel some peace.  The abiding message was that your loved ones never leave you, they are always there, guiding you.  That gave me some comfort and I hope you can take comfort from this too. Take Care. Sandra x\n",

      "That was actually the \"nice\" version. I left out the bits that I can't even bear to think about let alone say out loud. I told one of only friends afterwards that I don't think I could even imagine a worse way to die. It was truly horrific and has left me with what seem like PTSD symptoms. WHen you have that many lesions in your brain, it causes utter devastation. But that's not actually what's causing me most grief right now. Rather, like you (I think), I feel as if my heart and soul have been taken from me. Forever. My dad was my world. He wasn't a \"part of me\" as some people have suggested. He WAS me. And I was him. I know that sounds odd (and my friend who I sometimes speak to couldn't understand it). But I didn't distinguish between him and me. We weren't separate entities. We were one being. He was my soul, my sunshine, my other (and better) half. He was the hope and laughter. I really don't want to live without him. Every day the consciousness that I can never be with him again hits home and destroys me. I don't CARE about anything else, without him. I just want to cuddle him again and tell him I adore him. I know I sound like a child, but he was my meaning. The gulf betweeen him and everyone and everything else in the universe is enormous. He meant more to me than my own life. It's a worrying thought that. I don't think it's right or normal or healthy for me (or anyone) to pin everything on one person, like that. But what can I say? He was the most remarkable human I have ever come across. He gave the world meaning. And the only thing I want is to be with him again. Oh, and I feel as you do - most people DON'T get it. In fact, I've felt that NOBODY gets it, except for perhaps people here.\n",

      "I am really sorry to hear about your dad Sandra. Your dad sounds like mine in not letting the disease stop him from living. It must have been horrendous to lose him. I think you're right that it happened quickly (2 weeks). Sadly, my father's TORTURE went on for months. As I said in my previous post a moment ago, it couldn't have been any worse. If the devil himself had wanted to devise a more torturous way to die, he wouldn't have succeeded. Brain lesions are the worst, in my view, because your brain is everything - it controls your feelings, emotions, thoughts, speech, memories, movements, behaviour. Everything. Each one was taken away from my dad. One at a time. Slowly enough to be excruciating. But not slowly enough to allow him (or me) any respite. Even just writing these words is bringing back the pain, so I'll have to stop dredging up those memories. It sounds like you have a lot more strength and hope and ability to live than I do. I relied far too much on my dad. He was my favourite thing in the universe. \n",

      "Cancer is horrific in it's many forms and your poor dad sounds like he suffered tremendously but, if you can - and please, even though it seems impossible - please take some comfort that he is not suffering any longer.   Your love for your dad is so strong and it can remain so.  Your dad would not want you torturing yourself with the images of his horrendous last months and weeks, he would want you to remember the happy times and it is these, eventually, that will get you through this and out of the deep black hole of debilitating grief and despair.  I'm not sure if this will help or not, but this thought came to me just after I lost my dad and on the realisation that for the first time in my life, I no longer had parents.  This is the way it's meant to be.  Your parents are supposed to pass before us.  It's the circle of life. I agree, we don't get long enough time here and who knows for certain what's on the other side but I do believe that our loved ones never leave us.  Pay tribute to your dad by surviving this awful time. Sending strength to you x\n",

      "Thank you Sandra. Yes, I'm trying to remind myself that it's natural, normal and inevitable to lose one's parents. One of my problems has been that I've attached myself to them too much and not branched out and made meaningful relationships with others. My dad was (and is) everything to me - my hope, my laughter, my MEANING in life. That's what it is - he stood for everything. He was everything that's good about life.  Some people seem to be able to deal with the passing of their parents better than others. I always suspected (or rather KNEW) that I would not be one of them.  Anyway, thanks for your support and have a nice weekend\n",

      "Hi Paulus - it's tough for my mum of course. Awful, in fact. However, she wasn't anywhere near as close to my dad as I was. He wasn't her soulmate the way he was mine. She's actually picked herself up very well and is managing to get on with things in a way that I have not been able to emulate. You might have expected the reverse - the spouse (who's spent most of her adult life with the man) should be the one who finds it \"impossible\" to get over, who no longer sees any purpose in life etc. But that's not how it is. My mother's attitude (which is the right one) is: \"We should now make the most of OUR lives.\" I admire her tremendously. I only wish I had the same interest in life. Right now, I don't. By the way, don't think for one minute that I'm assuming everything is rosy in her world. It isn't. She has her low moments. She misses my dad. She has regrets. But overall she's getting on with things in a way that I have not been able to do (so far).\n",

      "Hello Adam (AKA Bras 1548), judging from everything you said, I know that your dad was one in a million (like mine)! I lost my dad to lung cancer 3 years ago. Like yours, my dad was my everything. Ever since I was a litte girl, I was afraid to lose him and I would cry at the thought of it. I remember he worked a blue-collar job just to support my mom and 3 kids. I also remember when he bought me a prom dress that he could barely afford. I can go on forever talking about all of the sacrifices that he made. For about the first 2 years after his passing, I felt like a lost soul or a leaf blowing in the wind without any direction. I also felt like you in many ways. I couldn't imagine life without him. I am 37 years old and still single with no kids because I also felt/ feel like you as far as not having interest in meeting anyone or starting a family. I actually ended a 14 year relationship shortly after my dad passed because when we lose a parent, our life tends to fall apart before it starts to get better. I feel like although our dads are no longer in the physical world, they are still working on us and helping us put things into perspective from the other side. I know you mentioned that nothing cliché seems to help such as \"what would your dad want for you\" or \"things will get better in time\". TRUST ME when I say that I know the pain you are feeling. My pain was so intense that my chest would hurt. It felt as though my heart was literally breaking but I still have my 77 year old mom and young nephews to look after. Suddenly and unexpectedly, I met someone who lost both of his parents before the age of 18 then I realized how fortunate I was to have my dad for 34 years as it could've been worse. I had moved over 1,100 miles away from my home state where I had lived the majority of my life. I knew no one nor did I have any memories of my dad there so the change of scenery somewhat helped. It's amazing what can happen when you're out of your comfort zone. I was offered the best job I had ever had without having applied for it. They paid for me to go back to school and earn my master's degree. I was then able to afford to build a house. My point is that I feel my dad is opening doors for me from the other side. I know that you don't see it right now but your dad will start opening doors for you too. Also, rather than thinking about how much time you have left on this earth without him, look at this way... every day that passes is a day closer to seeing him again but until then live as best as you can and make him proud. Don't  take any BS from anyone and be the person your dad intended for you to be. Live by the lifelong values that he instilled in you (for he will live through you). God bless you and your family... until you meet again. Your dad is dancing in the Lord's glory, Amen and Hallelujah!\n",

      "Hi rebvelaz83,Thanks for taking the time to write your message. I'm very glad to hear that your life has started to take a turn for the better. I can certainly imagine the benefits of being able to start afresh somewhere new with little or nothing to remind you of the loss. I have thought about moving abroad myself too. However, my job is here and my mother (who has had a cancer scare of her own) is also here, so I don't feel I can leave just yet.The depth of the pain I feel (when I remember the suffering my father endured, or reflect on the fact that I can't be with him again) is utterly overwhelming. The only thing I can think of that would make it better is being with him again - wrapping my arms around him and holding him. I've never loved or been loved by anybody like that. And it won't - it can't - happen again. I don't have my father's zest for life, or his enthusiasm for meeting people. I have nothing in me now. No desire, no hopes for the future, no interest in building a family of my own.Everything you say seems absolutely right to me. I just don't have any interest in life without my dad.\n",

      "Adam, I know exactly how you feel, I felt the same when my father died tewnty years ago. I can only offer you two thoughts. These are just the things that worked for me. I may be completely wrong about you in which case feel free to ignore what I say and curse me for a fool. Firstly you are right. Things don't \"get better in time\", all I can say is that in the end I got used to the fact that they weren't going to. Secondly I found that creating memorials helps. I sponsored a tiger at London Zoo and had them put up a plate commemorating him with the words \"He took his son to the zoo.\" I found someone to take over the steam engine he was building when he died and finish it. I put a lot of effort into finding quotations for his memorial stone. The point is that you've got a lot of energy from your love for him which is just exploding inside you because it's got nowhere to go. Putting that energy into creating things means you are passing his love on to other people. Hope that helps.R\n",

      "Thank you for your response, bras1548. Please note that although my life has somewhat changed for the better, I would trade it all just to have my dad back again. Knowing that he is not physically here to enjoy my life with me or that my future husband or kids will never know him, etc. makes me not want to have them. Sometimes I feel like I've already served my purpose which was to care for my parents. I know that for you and I both, the sun will never shine the same again... but it will shine again. I do not underestimate your pain and suffering over your tremendous loss because again, I know the magnitude of pain so take as much time as you need to grieve, cry, scream, etc. But also pray even to your dad. He can still hear you and your thoughts, and he will NEVER leave you. I think it's wonderful that you are still around for your mom as she needs you. Because your dad's passing is so recent, your wounds are fresh right now therefore you are remembering his suffering here on this earth but when those thoughts arise, try not to let them take over your mind. The next time that ANY negative thought enters your head, think or say \"NOT TODAY!\" and replace that thought with a happy memory of your dad. I promise you that in due time, there will come a time when you will think about him and just smile. You will think about your fond memories and laugh at funny moments that you both shared together. We are only passing through this earth until we reach our final destination. We are not meant to stay here. I understand how you feel when you say that you will never love or be loved the same way again. Even for me, no one can ever fill my dad's shoes or admire me the way he did. He was my biggest fan! I was definitely a \"daddy's girl\" and I still have my moments. It is okay and expected to feel depressed over the loss of your dad but be sure not to fall into a deep depression. As I previously mentioned, you will see him again. I hope that you find comfort in knowing that your dad is no longer suffering for he is whole and new again. His physical body was only a shell but his spirit is free now and lives on which is why I also previously mentioned that he is dancing and rerejoicing in the Lord's glory. It's okay to not feel optimistic about your future so just live for the day. Everything will be okay. Don't hesitate to ever reach out to me or anyone on this board as we have all felt and still feel your pain so you are not alone. I'm sure that your dad was a beautiful one of a kind man. God bless his soul.\n",

Like you, I would've traded places with him too but you know that we are not meant to go before our parents.

      "Yes, I know how you feel. My dad passed away 3 months ago from terminal brain cancer. It was said he'd have 2 years and that ruined me but I kept strong and positive for him to make sure he always had plenty of fun, cakes and wine. But then he suddenly passed away while having lunch one afternoon, he didn't even make it to 3 months after the diagnosis.  When he passed I attempted to kill myself but I realised afterwards how stupid I was for doing that. My dad loved life and fought so hard to survive. Yet I, a healthy young person tried to take my own life. It is not fair. I wish I could have swapped places with him. He brought more to this world than I ever could. His funeral covered the whole town, hundreds of people.\n",

      "Thank you for posting TeresaLoves. I have also wondered whether I would want to end my own life, just to eliminate the pain of being aware that the love of my life is gone. I haven't tried to kill myself but there are certainly moments when I think that the only way to deal with the horror of the loss is to be unconscious myself. Like you, though, I've also thought that killing myself would be the wrong thing to do. Funnily enough, I also, again like you, wished I could swap places with my dad, or at least to go with him. When he was dying I wanted to die with him. Since he's my other half, being separated from him is being separated from myself, my BETTER self.I am also angry because all this talk of \"winning the war against cancer\" is ********. In cases like my father's (and it seems your father's) we're not \"winning\" anything.Anyway, I hope you are finding some strength TeresaLoves. There are times when I feel I'm on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown and will end up needing to go into a mental health ward. I scream and shout and cry and feel so lost and desperate. And there's only one person I can think of who could make it better - my dad.\n",

      "Hi Bras, Its been a while since i've posted on here. It'll be 6 months on the 9th of this month since my Dad passed away. I wondered how you was getting on because its was about 5 months ago since I was last here. As for me, well I been trying to get on and feel like I had the weight of the world on my shoudlers, not only because Dad's gone, but because there was so much to sort out in the meantime. For some reason life decided to throw lots of challenges as soon as he died - i feel like it was a test of my metal. When Dad was ill, i recorded lots of audio recordings of him and me chatting. I am sat here tonight listening to a lot of those recordings and its bittersweet. It gives me great comfort and im so happy I did record him, however it makes me miss him even more and makes me very sad -  I just cannot believe he doesn't exisit anymore!?  For the brief moments I play the recordings, he is here with me, he is alive,  we are together in coversation. But he isn't physically here and it cuts so deep when I walk around thinking about it. I hope you are ok, you're definitely not alone... \n",

      "Hi Peacewind,Thanks for your message. I am not doing well. Like you, I recorded a few video/audio clips with my father before he passed away. However, I have daily regret that I didn't record more and didn't film when he was actually WELL and could communicate properly. Also, unlike you, I can't even bear to watch/listen to the ones I have. I an certainly imagine the bitterswet feelings you have as you watch/listen. I can't bring myself to experience those feelings. I feel as if I am going to have a mental breakdown whenever I get the feeling (which your feeling sounds like) that my father is there-but-not-actually-there. My only coping mechanism is complete avoidance. I can't look at photos of my dad. I DEFINITELY can't watch videos or hear audios. I actually don't know if I can put up with the situation as it is - awareness that my angel and the love of my life is gone.I am not interested in life without my dad. \n",

      "I am literally going through the same thing, dear. I too feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown and could just use a day with my dad to get me through. But you will get through this, you're a tough cookie. You're strongest than you know.I am not religious but I certainly believe in a higher power. Something that helps me is praying/meditation: I'll pray to my higher power and then I use my imagination to talk with my dad, it's like forced lucid dreaming but it's comforting. I'll just relax and close my eyes and visualise my dad sitting on a bench and I'm sitting next time him. We chat and I look at his face, it's lovely.My friend who lost his mother to cancer said he wrote his mother a letter, put it inside a balloon and let it go up into the sky. He told me that this action made him feel better, like a weight had been lifted. Perhaps you could do something similar when you're ready? I'm not ready to do that yet but when I am, I too will write my dad a letter and I'll send it via the ocean in a message in a bottle. Also, if you celebrate Christmas find a big item of your dads (I chose dad's guitar) and put Christmas fairy lights around it, decorate it beautifully for Christmas and put a candle next to it and I light the candle for him during December. It's weird but it really helps me, I sit next to it a lot and feel comforted.Make sure you get counselling. You are stronger than you could ever know and your dad wants you to live a full and happy life like he has. We can't spend our whole lives grieving, things get better from what I've been told by my auntie who found her dad committed suicide in their home when she was only a very young woman.Care for yourself and treat yourself, do anything that brings you any form of comfort and happiness. Book a holiday or something, just have things in the future to look forward to - this really does help. \n",

      "\"my dad was my evrything i miss him more than life itself\" - Yep. I loved my dad more than life itself. When he was dying I wanted to go with him. I would happily have died too if I could have stayed with my dad. I'd rather lose my life than be separated from my dad.My dad always wanted to see grandchildren. I didn't provide him with any (that he will see). I will live with that regret and pain forever too.\"at this moment in time im stuck in disbeleif and have not moved forward like people say  you should\" - Recently I have come to believe I may never move forward. I don't even really want to. I want to go back (not forward) and be with my dad again. I couldn't care less about anything else in life (a sign of depression, I know). All meaning in life was wrapped up with my dad. It's not healthy. Ideally I should have made other relationships with other people, e.g. had a wife and my own children, perhaps some siblings (I have none). But for me my dad was the be-all-and-end-all.I don't (yet) feel suicidal. But I have no interest in life. I also find it appalling that they have STILL not found a way to deal with cancer. You shouldn't have had to experience what you did. Nobody in this forum should have to experience what we experience. My mother lost her mother when she (my mother) was 60 years hold. Her mother (my grandmother) died \"naturally,\" essentially of old age, when she was 90. She (my grandmother) got to see and do everything she wanted in life. She had children and grandchildren, etc. She was ready to go. That's the way people \"should\" die, in my view. Not horrifically, before their time, in a way that scars their loved ones forever.I hope you find the strength I don't have, Sharon. Wishing you all the best\n",

Every day when I wake up my heart breaks and I feel a impending sense of doom because I don't know how I will continue without seeing my sweet dads lovely face or hearing his voice or giving him cuddles. Its devastating to know he will not be in my life anymore. He was on methotrexate and all his hair had fallen out, and I saw his decline but despite him telling me, I couldn't come to terms. My dad wanted to live so much and I am devastated he has passed away when he did everything that was good to try and stay alive. My papa was my soul and my heart. I miss listening to his songs with him like beatles and monkeys and lots of others. Films remind me off him. Its been 7 weeks since dad passed. 7 weeks of torture for me. Miss and love him. Papa wanted to see my wedding. He said zara I will wear this tie when you get married. I feel I let my papa down. He paid on car insurance and he couldn't drive his car because he was so unwell. I love my father..I have many regrets for being snappy sometimes. I really love him from every cell in my heart. I love you papa xxxz\n",

      "It's just S**T, isn't it? It's now been a year since my father passed away. Every day is the same. Like you, it seems, I go around feeling utterly devastated. Nothing can fill the whole he has left. I occasionally wonder what the h*ll the point is.It probably won't help you one bit Papalove (Zara?), but I too have the feeling that I let my father down (in several ways, including not giving him grandchildren). I wish you all the strength in the world to deal with the awfulness of it all.\n",

      "Hi Zara,Sorry for the delayed response.It has been just over 12 months since my father passed away. The feeling has not lessened at all. I have the same grief/pain/suffering in me every day. That's because my father was (and is) more important to me than everything else in the world combined. However, I don't want to give you a depressing message. I know that other people who have lost loved ones say that the feeling does lesson, for them anyway. Personally, I can't see how that will happen for me because, as I say, everything else in life combined is less than my father. He was quite simply the be-all-and-end-all for me.As for my dad's things, I haven't touched them. I don't look at them (if I can help it). I don't look at photos, or read emails or get involved with anything that is too closely related to my father. I can't stand the pain. It's literally unbearable. Not 'hard to bear.' But unbearable. So I avoid it.The only strategy that works for me is distraction. Watching stupid movies. Or writing essays. Or thinking about things that have nothing to do with my dad. Distraction.I just need my b****y dad back. That's the only thing I want.Wisihing you strengthA\n",

      "Well I know how you feel. Lost my Dad suddenly 22.4.19...let's say my enthusiasm to succeed in life has left me despite trying so hard. Sometimes Dads love you so much that nobody will ever love you like that again and its a hard feeling to deal with. I have 2 children, a lovely husband, a business that opened 1 month before covid so you have to keep fighting for your family...but deep down inside all I want is my Dad. Yes, he was my oxygen too and if you find a way to get your spark back let me know how. Instead I sit in silence because I hear people saying in my head \" well I've lost my dad too, or isn't it time she stopped going on about her Dad...\".....he was my best friend and I physically feel an ache in my heart for him...its a tough road pretending to be ok. Being by the ocean gives me some peace and watching the waves..its something. \n",

      "Like you Mbagpuss, nature (ocean, mountains, countryside) gives me some peace. And music (although I can't listen to anything linked to my father, which is about 95% of the music I love). You write: \"sometimes Dads love you so much that nobody will ever love you like that again and it's a hard feeling to deal with.\" Indeed. My father adored me in a way that nobody ever will. I adored him in a way that I will never adore anyone else. One of my friends objects and says: \"If you have a child, you may love him/her even more.\" I don't deny that if I ever had a child I would love that child immensely. I would. But (a) I have no interest whatsoever in having my own family/children, and (b) I will never have with a child (or anyone else) the love I had with my father. Everything I've ever valued in life has its roots in my father.You talk about getting the \"spark back.\" I lost that long ago. Probably when my father was first diagnosed (5 years ago). I've felt for some time now that it may be gone forever. My father basically WAS my spark. He ignited all my hopes and dreams. Without him, it's all pointless.\n",

      "bras1548,It made me teary reading your message because I understand what you are feeling and distractions can help in some way making days easier. Even with all my family, who love me, it was hard last year to care about their feelings especially in how I was acting and how they worried,  I was just numb. My Dad, like your Dad, had this hold on me I cannot explain. When that one person was your go to for everything in life, your life mentor, your friend,  your hug, your security....what do you do?Many times I have to tell myself off, just as my Dad would \"pull yourself together Tracey, we will all be gone one day, this is our journey and every human being and animal has to go through it\"..I guess its how we deal with it thats important. I have to remember how prescious life is and what would my Dad want me doing right now, feeling this way. He would tell me to pull myself together and each day I have choices. I can choose to do do or be anyone I want because I'm  alive and thats what he would tell me. He would be disappointed that I would feel so sad every day and explain to me, he too had to go on when he lost his parents. Girls have a connection with their Dads, genetically we are them in many ways, we carry their behaviours and mannerisms and say things just as they would.  I'm going to take up surfing, I'm going to start doing things I never thought I could do and maybe you could try that too. I have dogs, 3, the naughty ones distract me and it makes get out every day and walk. Try something new...it helps, every little bit helps. Your Dad would want you to I'm  sure.\n",

      "Hi Mbgagpuss,Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I understand the idea or the principle of 'getting on my my life.' And like you, I know that my father would indeed want me to live it to the max. But when everything I do from now on is without him, I don't really care about doing it. There is one thing and one thing only that I want - to wrap my arms around my father and cuddle him and never let go. I want to hold his hand and tell him how much I adore him. I couldn't care less about meeting other people. They're not my dad. I used to love reading novels, but they are completely empty now without my dad. I used to love listening to classical music and jazz. I don't listen to either now because they are tied up with my dad. Everything I love can be traced back to my dad. My counsellor said that it sounded like I had \"lost part of myself\" when I lost my father. He was wrong. I lost half of myself, or two thirds of myself, or, more accurately still, all of world that matters. The world has no meaning for me without my dad. There is no world for me without my dad. Unless I can be with him at the end of a day, unless I can cuddle him, or share something with him, or hold his hand, or listen to music with him, or feel his love, or see him smile when he feels mine it's all meaningless.It would be manageable if I could communicate with my dad from time to time (like Simba and Mufasa do in the Lion King). He was and is more to me than everything else in the universe combined.\n",

After getting through losing my mum 3 years ago and going through a 3 year divorce, we thought we would at last have a nice Christmas, with my dad and my daughter, but I found my dad dead in his chair at home alone. He had been there for 2 weeks . I will never know if he suffered , I never got to say all I wanted to , I can't look at his photos , I can't talk about it as I just break down , I am not coping at all and now I have all the problems of dealing with his estate and I am being pressured to get his house on the market. Too many memories in the house of happy times , I can't let go. I don't know how to cope with this .\n",

      "Hi mate,I know how you feel, i was just 13 to 14 when we found out my dad had cancer it didnt really affect me much at the time becasue i was still too young to understand what cancer really was i ean iwas young and was living my life well... Me and my dada were very close one morning he colapsed in the toilet and fell against the door i was the only one small enough to fit thought the gap in the door to get to him which i did and after that day it changed me i then realised that this wasnt just a col and then i took time of school, that day we waited for the ambulance to coe and little did i know that he would never return home from the hospital. My dad had stage four lung cancer which spread to the bone marrow and some other location which my mum refused to tell me about becasue she didnt want me to get worried.I remember the day well we were all at home when my mam came into the kitchen collected us all together and said we need to prepare to say goodbye to him which from that moment i made my mam promise me that she would wake me up or drag me from anything i was doing and to get the nurses to tell me when it was about to happen becasue i was going to be there come rain or shine, he used to be there for me all the time when i was ill and tell me that he wishes he could take the illness from me and fight it off well i wish i couldve done it or him or atleast shared his suffering he was by my side when i almost died of ecoli so i wanted to be beside his.the dreadful morning came it was a normal night the night bfore we got ack from the hosptial and went for bed ready for school i belive then my mum comes into my room at 3am wakes me up and sais \"Morgan its happening.\" and i got up casually grabbed my shoes and duvet we tried to wake my sister and brother up but they didnt want to come i remeber we drove to the hopsital as fast as we could what usually takes an hour drive took us half an hour mainly becasue our speed and no traffic being on the roads, the roads were eerly quite this morning i was reletiely calm and cant recall any feelings i felt.     we got the hospital and the nurses had opened the back doors for us my dad had his own room and when we got in he was gasping for air he couldnt speak but i knew he knew i was there i remember saying hello to him and saying that everything was going to be okay at this point i started remembering all the times we had together still reltively calm but also felt abit anxious.I remmeber getting on the recliner chair next to his bed and lied down with my duvet over me and said to him \"its okay dad were here now you can rest.\" or something like that i cant really remember becasue after that i fell asleep it was 20 past 4 when i fell asleep it was wierd becasue i didnt feel tired i woke up at around 5:15 feeling normal everything was calm i didnt look at my dad, my mum pulled me out of the room and all the nurses looked at me they asked my mum if i was okay i still didnt know what had happened yet we got into the room with the xbox that i was used to and my mum sat me down on the sofa and said \"Morgan your dads dead\" and all i could think of saying was atleast he can rest now after the amount of struggle i saw him in i was still calm for some reason i dont know why i fell asleep perfectly timed i asked to see him one last time i went in remember seeing him there lying so pieacfully i remember stroking his head and kissing his forehead i said something like goodnight or rest easy and we left i dont know how i was so calm and i didnt cry once i really dont know how becasue its affecting me more now. maybe its becasue i was there when it happened i really dont know i miss him so much and not a day goes by where i think if he was here how proud he would be of me and myasbirations and my achievments we would be building that model train he always wanted to build and life would be good.after it happned i went back to school 2 weeks later they didnt expect me to come back so soon and i didnt need counselling i still dont know to this day how i was so calm and so okay with it. now im not i now live with health anxiety and have found a lump in my nck which i am terrified to be cancer as i dont want to pull my famoly thoguh the same thing as a phew years ago and im not ready to die i have to live my life to the fullest like my dad couldnt.i am so sorry for the long message but i hope this helps as you arent alone you really arent i know how it feels and although it didnt affecting me then it affects me now.now mate if you ever need to talk dont hesitiate to message me privatly and i will give you my number to call if you ever need a chat please mate just enjoy your life and make your padre proud theres no getting him back and i know how hard it sounds but lifes a ***** and it only happens to the best of people. I wish you all the best,Morgan.\n",

      "Hi Morgan, Thank you for taking the time to share your story. It's funny how people react so differently. I was literally screaming and shouting and going crazy when I realised my father had only hours (or at best days) to live. I lost my mind and had two complete breakdowns during which I was absolutely hysterical. Now, a year later, I feel dead inside. I have no interest in living my life. I just want to be with my dad. He was the best and most important thing in my life.I really hope your thing isn't serious and that you're able to do what you want to do. Thanks again, A\n",

      "Hi Adam,you sound just like me I could've written your posts although my dad died coming up to 10 years ago now. I lost all interest in life for years I was severly depressed (still am although it's not so much about my dad anymore), and my mum had got on with her life and still loves life which I can't get my head around at all. She even makes out like my dad didn't suffer that much when he actually suffered about as much as anyone ever could.I also became an atheist and still am which I never thought would happen as even though I wasn't ever religious I definitely believed in god. I decided not to have kids because I never would want to put them through life and I have a very negative opinion of life and lack of interest in everything other people seem to enjoy. Overall I think it is not worth the pain and stress and I became very angry at all parents for having kids, putting them through life and then leaving them. Even though I know parents really do love their kids and would do anything for them I just couldn't do it to mine.I've honestly almost completely wasted the last 10 years of my life and that makes me angry at my dad too for putting me through that grief although most of it is down to me in the end. I just don't want that to happen to you, you have to get out of yourself and get out there (obviously hard at the moment) and talk to people or you will get stuck in negative depressed feelings like I have.Trust me I know what you are going through and I'm so sorry, the pain will always be there you just have to take your mind off it as much as possible by doing stuff and not get stuck thinking about it all the time it will make things worse. I hope you start to feel better soon x\n",

      "Hi cantmoveon,Your name 'cantmoveon' seems very fitting for what I imagine will be the case for me. The idea of living the rest of my life without my father is completely unacceptable to me. He WAS my life. He was the sun, the moon, the stars, the oxygen, the hope, the love, the warmth, everything. Everything good sprung from my father. When I do think for more than a moment about what I've lost, I get close to having a complete nervous/mental breakdown. I'm not suicidal. But if I had the option of ceasing to live but being reunited my father, I would take it. When he was lying in the hospital bed (in which he died), I wanted to get in with him and go with him. Being separated from my father is...well, there is no word for it. I agree 'in principle' with your recommendation, i.e. that I get out there and talk to people. I just don't have any desire to do that. There's only one person I want to connect with. And I can never connect with him again.Like you, I am an atheist. I can see no reason why any human should have to experience this sort of suffering. I just wish I could communicate with my dad from time to time. I loved him more than life. More than life.\n",

      "Hi yeh I had the name a couple years ago and shortly afterwards I think I finally \"got over\" the death of my father (as much as is possible) I never thought it would happen and it took around 8 years which is a hell of a lot of time. It was compounded by the fact he suffered SO much and other stuff that also happened around the same time which was really bad timing and made everything worse. Occasionally I still have my bad days and think about it and still come on this site from time to time but it's not all consuming like it was. It still remains an incredibly painful time in my life though of course.I get what you mean, I think when I lose my mum that will be it for me I can't imagine bothering with living after that I basically know I'm just here for my mum and I have barely any family left so once my mum is gone really don't see any reason to stick around. I've always asked my mum what is the point in life what do you actually enjoy about it? I can't say I've ever really enjoyed anything much even when I was a kid. Always wish I hadn't been born sad to say and never understood how people can enjoy life with all the suffering that goes on. I have no ambitions or dreams for the future now I'm just going through the motions.I'm extremely sensitive and empathetic, like the most emotional out of anyone else I know and I think you are too and a lot of people won't get how we feel to the same extent-it's hard being like this for sure. Sometimes I can't cope with the amount of suffering that goes on in life, how incredibly tragic it all is and I can't believe my mum brought me here sometimes to see and feel these things. Anyway it's still quite early on for you I just wanted you to have a perspective of someone a few years down the line-not saying it will take you as long to start feeling better as it has me hopefully not. It's so incredibly hard to lose a parent especially when you've watched them suffer and it's one of the last memories you have of them and you were really close.\n",

      "Thanks again cantmoveon. Like you, I've had premonitions of what life will be like when I lose my mother. She is elderly too and has had cancer scares of her own. When she goes, I will be all alone in the world as I am an only child. I will still have a few friends but they are not family. There will be nobody who loves me the way a parent loves you. Like you, I'm not sure I will want to remain alive when I lose my mother.Yes, I too saw my father suffer. He was diagnosed with 30 brain lesions (yes, 30). They had never seen anything like it. It slowly took over his brain, and caused psychological and physical torture in my father. Seeing that has scarred me for life. Like you, I don't see the sense or meaning in the world when good people (like my father) are made to suffer like that. The effects of the brain lesions were horrific. It was like a horror movie.I just wish I (believed I) could communicate with my dad again. The only thing I want is to be with him. I will never love anybody like that, and nobody will ever love me like that. What is the point in it all when you lose the love of your life?\n",

      "Hi Adam,Yeh I have the same fears as you-my mum also battled cancer when I was a teen, I very easily could've lost her-if that had happened and I then had to go through watching my dad die aswell I can't imagine I'd be here right now. I've always worried about my parents-I'm not an only child but was a late baby so only have much older siblings who are not a support to me. It makes sense why you were extra close to your dad being an only child. And yeh I get it there is no one like your parents-you can have your own family but it's not the same sort of support, marriages break up and any kids you have need you for support not the other way around. I see my family as the one I was born with can't imagine making another one or it being anything close.Am so sorry your dad suffered as well-my dad had a couple of brain lesions and for the cancer he had (prostate) this is meant to be very rare, like less than 1% or 2% of men with that cancer have it spread to the brain. So I know what you mean about our dads suffering so much and having rare complications, you just don't think your loved one is going to be in the 2% or less category. As if cancer isn't horrific enough you have an extra level to deal with, something even the doctors aren't expecting. It's so traumatic to watch loved ones going through that.I wish I could talk to my dad again aswell, or that I had a time machine, it's hard to imagine you will never see someone again.\n",

      "Hi SamC93,Thanks for your thoughts. Like you, I find it extremely unhelpful when people say those things. Here are the things that I find completely useless:- \"What would your father want for you?\"- \"He'll always be with you\"- \"You have to live your life now\"- \"It will get better with time\"I don't WANT to live without my dad. He WAS my life. Or at least the key part of my life. He was the sunshine in my world. The idea of letting him go and living my own life (without him) is appalling to me. I'm glad you're finding strength somewhere \n",

      "Hi, I lost my mom 4 months ago and I have the same feelings.  I don't know how I can go on without her, the rest of my family, Dad and Sister are already gone. I  Ilive in the US.  Since November I went back to my place in Las Vegas, I flew to where she lived in Florida yesterday.  Last night I was very sad but OK, no crying.  Today after starting to get rid of alot of her stuff mainly old papers, I finally broke down and have been hysterical for the last hour. I can't call anybody because I don't want to cry on the phone to them.  I spent a good deal of time in her house in the past.  I keep crying out I don't want to be here anymore, meaning on this planet. However I am here and I'm going to be here and that's what's the most frightening thing.  My mother didn't have cancer but she left fairly abruptly.  I'm don't feel like a full human being without her.  I cry out begging for someone to help me, knowing there is nothing anyone can do. Yeah I spoke with my nephew 2 days ago, we were never really close except when he was growing up.  I had to tell him it's been 2 months since you called, you said you were going to call in a few days, which he denied saying, he could have called anyway he knew what I'm going through, it was also his grandmother.  I'm 61 , he's 35.  During the conversation he said, people die and you have to move on, what a ****. I'm with you Bras. I don't want to live without my mom, but the fact is I'm going to have to, I'm not going to end my life. People say you have to keep busy, it sucks that you have to do that just to get your mind off the only person that was the most important person ever in my life. I guess that's all for now, I regret so much \n",

      "Hi gpb959,I saw your post and just wanted to send a reply to say I'm sorry to hear of what you're going through at the moment - it sounds like a really tough situation and especially with the difficulties with the family too.In terms of support, the services we would usually suggest on this forum are UK-based. However there are some resources for grief on this site here which may be of some help.Wishing you all the best and I hope that in time things gradually can become a little easier for you - or more manageable at least.BenCancer Chat Moderator\n",
